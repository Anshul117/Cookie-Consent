 🍪 Cookie Consent (Totally Not Shady™)

A humorous "cookie consent" modal for the web, inspired by the *too-honest-for-their-own-good* approach.  
Instead of just telling users you store cookies, this modal pretends to upload their soul to the dark web.  
Because why *not* have some fun with privacy banners?
