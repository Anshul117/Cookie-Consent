# 🍪 Cookie Consent (Totally Not Shady™)

A humorous "cookie consent" modal for the web, inspired by the *too-honest-for-their-own-good* approach.  
Instead of just telling users you store cookies, this modal pretends to upload their soul to the dark web.  
Because why *not* have some fun with privacy banners?

## 🚀 Demo

When the page loads:
1. After 1.5 seconds, a modal appears asking for consent.
2. If the user tries to **Decline**, the buttons swap positions to make it harder to click "Decline".
3. On form submission, the modal pretends to:
   - Upload data to the dark web (loading animation)
   - Make "the sale"
   - Display a final "Thank you, you sucker!" message.
